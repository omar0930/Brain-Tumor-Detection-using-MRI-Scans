# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-MRI-Scans
This code is designed for the detection of brain tumors using MRI scans. It involves several key steps, including data preprocessing, model training, and prediction. The code utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify MRI images into normal or tumor categories , This project aims to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect brain tumors from MRI images. The model classifies the images into two categories: normal and tumor.
Model Building:
- Use a CNN architecture to build the model.
- Compile the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer.
- Train the model using the training dataset.
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV, PIL, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Seaborn
